**This database tries to solve that**. It features 300.000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs, Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets. It therefore allows you to obtain a broad overview of sectors, industries, types of investments and much more.

The aim of this database is explicitly *not* to provide up-to-date fundamentals or stock data as those can be obtained with ease (with the help of this database) by using the [Finance Toolkit 🛠️](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit). Instead, it gives insights into the products that exist in each country, industry and sector and gives the most essential information about each product. With this information, you can analyse specific areas of the financial world and/or find a product that is hard to find. See for examples on how you can combine this database, and the earlier mentioned packages the section [Usage](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase#usage).
